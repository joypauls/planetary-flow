## Dev

> Not fully documented yet, see `Makefile` for commands to get started!

Currently using Python version `3.11.3` in development. Unfortunately there is no testing with other versions yet, but if you'd like to get started hacking on the project I'd recommend [pyenv](https://realpython.com/intro-to-pyenv/).

This project uses `poetry` to manage dependencies, environments, and as a simple build tool.

### Dev Dependencies in Poetry

poetry add ipykernel --group dev
