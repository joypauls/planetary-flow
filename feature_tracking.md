# Feature Tracking

Just some TODO items to stay sane

## POC Features

A basic demonstration to evaluate how realistic the project is. Proving out that this app will be doable with fairly common tools (numpy, opencv) with acceptable results. No polish.

Algorithms
- [ ] object segmentation / thresholding
- [ ] frame stabilization
- [ ] basic global quality estimator

Tooling
- [ ] basic CLI task runner
- [ ] basic unit tests (~20% coverage?)


## Prototype Subtasks

- [ ] reference frame selection / generation
- [ ] better alignment to reference frame
- [ ] image averaging
- [ ] generate grid of patches
- [ ] local quality estimator
- [ ] channel alignment


## MVP Subtasks

TBD

- [ ] channel alignment
