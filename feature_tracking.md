# Feature Tracking

Just some TODO items to stay sane

## POC Features (‚≠ê)

A basic demonstration to evaluate how realistic the project concept is. Proving out that this app will be doable with fairly common tools (numpy, opencv) with acceptable results. No polish. All visualization will be done with opencv's built in viz 
tools, no custom GUI yet.

Algorithms
- [x] basic object segmentation / thresholding
- [x] global frame stabilization
- [ ] basic global quality estimator
- [ ] configurable output size
- [ ] basic info display on screen 

Tooling
- [x] basic CLI as a task runner
- [ ] basic unit tests (~20% coverage?)


## Prototype Subtasks

TBD

## MVP Subtasks

TBD

- [ ] channel alignment
